## üëã Introduction
Lime is a *cross-platform* framework that is focused on game modding and tries to provide you with useful features for your journey.


## üóíÔ∏è Features
- Detours
  - x86/x86-64
  - Lambda support
- Instruction
  > Allows to work with instructions (i.e. follow jumps/calls, ...)
- Memory Pages
  > Easily allocate and work with memory pages
- Module
  - Iterate Loaded Modules
  - Iterate Symbols
  - Load Modules
- Address
  - Read / Write Data
- Signature Scanner
  - Supports Traditional & IDA Signatures
- Cross-Platform Entrypoint
- Proxy-DLL Generation _(For MinGW)_

> Lime follows the `RAII` paradigm, so you won't have to care about manually cleaning anything up (i.e. when allocating a page).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Static Entrypoint
```cmake
set(lime_static_entrypoint ON)
```

Use a platform-independent method for the entrypoint implementation.  
You do not need to enable this to make use of the cross-platform entrypoint!

### VirtualAlloc2
```cmake
set(lime_no_alloc2 OFF)
```

Can be used to disable the usage of `VirtualAlloc2`.  

This should be used for compatibility with wine as it currently does not support the `LowestStartingAddress` requirement.
